# Team Collaboration

## Techniques and tools to help improve communication in your web projects.

After working independent for the past 8 years, I have seen a few things that
went good and quite a few that have not. When things break down, it’s almost
always due to poor communication.

It doesn’t have to be like this.

We’ll discuss the mindsets of everyone involved with seeing a project succeed
and what tools or techniques can help to fill the communication gap.

## Running the Presentation

The presentation is built using [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/).
You can run the application by installing Node/NPM on your system, then running
`npm install`. You will also need to run `bower install` after installing the
[Bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower/) package globally, if it's not already.

After the dependencies are installed, you can run `npm start` to start the local
web server to run the presentation. Clicking the "s" key will open a new window
where you can view your notes and preview the next slide.
