Before sending me hatemail if you weren't at the talk and stumble across this
around the internet, please note that this talk is a piece of satire that also
happened to provide some useful advice in a fun way, and if you still feel the
need to yell pedantry at me over the anonymity of the internet, you're probably
the exact kind of person I was making fun of.

(it's ok, I still love you!)
