# Building decoupled polyglot applications with Vert.x

By [@tcrawley](http://twitter.com/tcrawley)

Vert.x is an asynchronous application platform built on top of Netty
that supports several JVM languages: Clojure, Groovy, Java,
JavaScript, JRuby, Jython, PHP, and Scala. It uses a multi-reactor
model to efficiently serve a high number of concurrent connections,
and greatly simplifies distributed component coordination by providing
built-in message passing between components, up to and including the
browser!

In this talk, I'll provide an introduction to Vert.x, and cover the
trade-offs of using it for developing polyglot applications.
